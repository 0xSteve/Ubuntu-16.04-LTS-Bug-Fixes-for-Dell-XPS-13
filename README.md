# Ubuntu-16.04-LTS-Bug-Fixes-for-Dell-XPS-13
should fix some of the typical problems with the migration over to 16.04 LTS on Dell. Just use the bash file that matches your problem.

#For the screen_flicker.sh file
To run this file, go to the directory it is in from terminal and type:
bash screen_flicker.sh
#Description
My program is not asking you for your password, it is your computer asking so you can update your apt-get repositories.
All it will do is reinstall xorg stuff, and ask you if you would like to reboot.
If the flickering persists, and you are using Chrome, or Chromium, then please ensure that hardware acceleration is turned on.
This is going to reduce screen flicker significantly while using these applications if you have a high res display.
cheers!
